    :param site_phases: Shape ``(quotient,)``, complex.
    The phase factors that must be multiplied into each site when producing
    displacements from the eigenvector. Should be of the form ``e ^ (i q.x)``.

    :param translation_sfracs: Shape ``(quotient, 3)``, real.
    The quotient space translations (PC lattice modulo super cell),
    in units of the supercell basis vectors.

    :param translation_deperms: Shape ``(quotient, sc_sites)``, integral.
    Permutations such that ``(carts + translation_carts[i])[deperms[i]]``
    is ordered like the original carts. (i.e. when applied to the coordinate
    data, it translates by ``-1 * translation_carts[i]``)

    For any vector of per-site metadata ``values``, ``values[deperms[i]]`` is
    effectively translated by ``translation_carts[i]``.

    :param translation_phases: Shape ``(quotient, sc_sites)``, complex.
    The phase factors that must be factored into each atom's components after
    a translation to account for the fact that permuting the sites does not
    produce the same images of sites as actually translating them would.

    :param gpoint_sfracs: Shape ``(quotient, 3)``, real.
    Translations in the reciprocal quotient space, in units of the reciprocal
    lattice basis vectors.

    (SC reciprocal lattice modulo primitive BZ)

    :param qpoint_sfrac: Shape ``(3,)``, real.
    The Q point in the SC reciprocal cell at which the eigenvector was computed.

    :param eigenvector: Shape ``(sc_sites, 3)``, complex.
    A normal mode of the supercell. (arbitrary norm)

    :param gamma_only: boolean.
    A switch that causes the output to only contain the gamma probability.
    (all other elements will be zero)

    :return: Shape ``(quotient,)``, real.
    Probabilities of `eigenvector` projected onto each point
    ``qpoint + gpoints[i]``.
